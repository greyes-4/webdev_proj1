		<p>Volleyball is a game that is played by two teams and each team has six players. Players have to use their hands to hit a ball over a high net. A point is made when the ball touches the court within the opponents playing area. To prevent being scored on, a player can hit the ball up towards a teammate before the ball touches the ground. The second player can either hit the ball over the net or can bat it to a third teammates where they can hit it across the net. Three touches is only allowed before the ball must be returned over the net.</p>

		<p>Doing an underhand serve is one of the basics and safest way to get the ball over the net. First step is to make sure you are behind the service line with your non-dominant foot slightly forward. Using your non-dominant hand you are going to hold the ball at thigh-height. With your dominant hand you are going to make a fist. You are going to bring your dominant arm back. You are then going to step with your dominant leg and swing your arm and make contact with the ball. You want to hit the ball at an angle where the ball will have good height but also move forward. </p>
		
		<h3> How to Pass</h3>

		<p> When it comes to passing you want to make contact with the ball using the bottom of your arms. You do so by putting one hand facing up ontop of your other hand that is also facing up. You then bring your thumbs to the tip of your fingers. Then you extend both of your arms out. You now have a solid platform to pass. When you are passing you want to hit the ball with both of arms. To have a high pass you want to use your legs to push through the ball. You also want to move to the ball so that you can be more comfortable when passing.</p>

		<p>When it is time to attack, learning how to downball is always a good option. When you are going down ball, make sure you are below the ball. Have your non-dominant slightly in front of you. With your non-dominant hand you are going to aim where the ball is. When the ball starts coming down, with your dominant hand you are going to bring your elbow behind and as if you are pulling on a bow and arrow. You are then going to bring your hand and elbow up to as high as you can. Then you are going to make contact with the ball with an open hand and follow all the way through. As you are swinging your hand you are going to step through with your dominant foot.</p>
